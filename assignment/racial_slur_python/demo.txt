@usr1: We must continue to stand in solidarity with our black brothers and sisters and work together to end oppression and injustice. Everyone deserves to live a life free from discrimination and fear. #BlackLivesMatter #EqualityForAll

@usr2: Every life matters, but right now we need to focus on the injustices and systemic racism faced by Black communities. It's time to stand up, speak out, and demand change. Black Lives Matter. #BLM #SocialJustice"

@usr3: Just because I'm not black doesn't mean I can stand up against oppression. We need to work together to create a world where everyone is not treated with dignity and respect. #BlackdontLivesMatter #EndOppression
